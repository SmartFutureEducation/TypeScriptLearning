"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output."

"It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs."

JavaScript basics are required to start your TypeScript projects. Here're some references for basics. More can be easily found.
